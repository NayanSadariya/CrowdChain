# Crowd Chain

I am proud to share that Crowd Chain is a future on Shark Tank project! The idea behind Crowd Chain is to break the barriers of traditional crowdfunding by creating a permissionless platform where everyone can be a Shark. Unlike the limited 5 investors on Shark Tank, weâ€™ve built a system where anyone can participate as an investor and help fund innovative ideas.

## Key Features

- **Platform Charges**  
  Crowd Chain takes a nominal platform fee of **0.5%** to maintain and enhance its services.

- **Fairness and Accountability**  
  All agreements between investors and creators are secured through **government-approved e-contracts**. Fake investors or creators can be identified, and actions taken against them under legal jurisdictions.

- **KYC Verification**  
  Ensures authenticity through **Digilocker integration**. Currently, the KYC process approves Aadhaar numbers, with testing conducted using Aadhaar number: **932858776922** (testing purposes only).

- **Blockchain Integration**  
  Blockchain technology secures contracts using **MetaMask**.  
  Smart contracts ensure secure and tamper-proof authentication.  
  Uses **Web3.js** and **Ethers.js** for Ethereum blockchain interaction.  
  Passwords are hashed using Web3 utilities for enhanced security.

- **Unique UI Design**  
  A completely unique and visually appealing **landing page** ensures a great first impression and user engagement.
